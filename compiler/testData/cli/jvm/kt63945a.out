This mode is not recommended for production use,
as no stability/compatibility guarantees are given on
compiler or generated code. Use it at your own risk!

compiler/testData/cli/jvm/kt63945.kt:5:17: warning: type argument for type parameter 'T' cannot be inferred because it has incompatible upper bounds: A, B (multiple incompatible classes). This will become an error in a future release.

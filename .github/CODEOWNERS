# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository.


# In this example, @JetBrains/kotlin-build-infrastructure
# owns any files in defined .space directory and any of
# its subdirectories.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo.

/**
 * Represents a reported instance of a diagnostic.
 *
 * Each diagnostic has mandatory properties and optional "attachable"  properties.
 * Mandatory properties are enumerated in the constructor, and participate in equality comparisons (affects tests)
 *
 * "Attachable" properties are not part of the constructor, and do not participate in equality comparison by default. Then can be
 * initialized later after diagnostic creation, or even never initialized at all.
 * By convention, [ToolingDiagnostic] exposes `attachX` methods for configuring attachable properties, e.g. [attachStacktrace]
 *
 * IMPORTANT. All fields referenced from the diagnostic should be serializable.

         * - lead to unpleasant UX in IDE (if the failure happens during import, then depending
